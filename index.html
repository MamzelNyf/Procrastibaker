                <h2 class="section__title">Hi, I'm Fanny</h2>

                <p> Positive, hard-working and an insatiable learner, I like to define myself as a Web Designer.
                    But I'm not only a job title.<br>
                    I'm a Foodie and I'm lucky enough to have a Chef at home who is cooking amazing dishes.<br>
                    I love Nature, hiking in beautiful and preserved places provides me with such a positive feeling and powerful energy. Caring for our Environment is part of my everyday routine.<br>
                    I love Colours, Layout, Photography, Painting, Digital manipulation... I think we all have gifts to make Life prettier.<br>
                    I'm a Cat lover and I can't wait to have a permanent situation to be able to take care of one (or many). For now, I'm just melting each time I watch videos and photos of cats. <br>
                    
                    I have started She{Codes} Plus program in June 2020, to develop my knowledge in web development, meet passionate women with similar interests and build a tech network in Perth.<br>
                    But most of it, it is another step in my new life in Australia and I'm excited to find a community I belong to.<br>
                    
                    I realised a few months ago that I was missing an important thing from France (besides my family): a Crunchy French style Baguette. I have started reading blogs, watching videos, following tutorials... Baking is actually like learning a new programming language! Step-by-step, by practising, it becomes easier and better.<br>
                    
                    Let me share with you an enjoyable way to escape from the computer and satisfy a craving for crunch: Procratisbaking!<br>
